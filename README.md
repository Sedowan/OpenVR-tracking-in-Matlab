# OpenVR-tracking-in-Matlab
Use the OpenVR API to get live tracking data into Matlab. Relaese as soon as my Masterthesis is complete. Please contact me if you need help in the mean while.

This Project will get live tracking data from the HMD via OpenVR onto the command window of Matlab. It will send the last reseived psition as variable into the Workspace of Matlab.

This project is featured by Peter Thor's OpenVR-Example C code also found on Github.

The aim of this project is to have a Simulink block which uses the OpenVR API to use any supported HMD in the Simulink workspace.
